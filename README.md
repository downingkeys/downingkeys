Hey there 👋🏻

My name is Tim. I'm an entry level software engineer coming from the world of music. I graduated Summa cum Laude from Berklee College of Music and spent the next two decades as a touring musician and church worship leader. In 2020, COVID separated me from most of my music work, and a house fire separated me from my piano. While I was out of my house for the fire damage restoration, I decided to take up the advice of many of my software friends and “Learn to Code”.

I started with Michael Hartl’s “Learn Enough” series where I became familiar with the Command Line, Text Editor, GitHub, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Ruby, and Ruby on Rails. Since then, I’ve been learning Elixir and Phoenix through a combination of books, Udemy courses, and a course from The Pragmatic Studio. This has mostly been self-study, but I’ve had help from many friends in the software business.

I’m looking forward for the real learning to begin as I transition from self-study to entry level employment.
